  A handbag is any type of bag or case that can be carried either by hand or over the shoulder. Such bags are traditionally marketed to women, who use these bags to carry their cosmetics, money, and personal belongings. ... Handbags also may be closed in some way, either by gathering up the straps, or with a snap or clasp.
